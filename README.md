# Week3_CaseStudy_AnnCliff
Applying SQL skills to solve real-world data problems using a case study, simulating professional tasks that can be encountered in the field.

Case Study Scenario: Sales Data Analysis 
- Background: 
 A retail company, "TechMart," is analyzing its sales data to understand 
customer purchasing behavior, product performance, and regional sales 
trends. I analyzed the dataset and provided actionable insights.

- Dataset Description: 
 The provided dataset contains four tables: 
 - `Customers`: Details about customers (e.g., customer ID, name, age, 
location). 
 - `Products`: Information on products (e.g., product ID, name, category, 
price). 
 - `Stores`: Store details (e.g., store ID, name, city). 
 - `Sales`: Sales transaction records (e.g., sale ID, customer ID, product 
ID, store ID, quantity, sale date).

Project Goal: 
Analyzed the data using SQL and made recommendations for increasing 
sales and improving customer satisfaction.

- Data Cleaning: 
 - Checked for missing or inconsistent data in the dataset. 
 - Handled invalid records and standardized values (e.g., ensuring uniform city 
names).

- SQL Techniques Used: 
 - `WHERE` clauses for filtering data. 
 - `JOIN` operations to merge data across tables. 
 - Aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG` with `GROUP 
BY` for summarizing data.

- Key Analysis Approaches: 
 - Calculated metrics such as total sales per product, average purchase 
value, and regional sales distribution. 
 - Used comparison operators to filter results for specific conditions (e.g., 
high sales months). 
 - Created reusable query results using views. 

Completed the following tasks using SQL: 
1. Customer Analysis: 
 - Identified the top 5 cities with the highest number of unique customers. 
 - Determined the age group that spends the most on average. 
2. Product Analysis: 
 - Listed the top 5 most frequently purchased products. 
 - Calculated the total sales for each product category. 
3. Sales Performance: 
 - Calculated the total monthly sales for the year. 
 - Identified the store generating the highest revenue. 
4. Regional Trends: 
 - Compared sales across regions (e.g., North, South, East, West). 
 - Identified the region with the highest average sale value. 
5. Customer Loyalty: 
 - Highlighted customers who made purchases every month. 
 - Calculated the percentage of repeat customers. 

I documented my processes, by saving the queries correctly and created a short report, summarizing my findings and the rationale behind the queries. 
 - Included visual representations where appropriate (e.g., tables, charts).
 - Employed PowerBI to create a summary report dashboard highlighing key insights to make informed decisions.
